# Personal Scripts

Some nonspecific scripts I've written for personal use which may or may not be useful for others.   

- **undir**: Takes a nested directory tree and dumps all files to the parent directory and removes all directories. 
- **dater**: Tries to sort all images and videos into dated directories. First through media metadata (EXIF, video data), and then through filesystem data. I plan to add a way to parse common filenames in the future. 
- **reduce30**: Reduces JPG image quality to 30% using Imagemagick. Replaces the original file. 
- **reduce30all**: Reduces *all* JPG images to 30% quality inside a directory. Replaces the original files. 
- **keepaliveaudio.sh**: Plays an inaduible sound that prevents my s^$@&# speakers from going to sleep. I have it paired with a systemd timer to play every 5 minutes. 
- **screenshot**: Screenshot and save, and copy to clipboard.
- **screenshot_0x0**: Screenshot and save, and upload to 0x0.st, and copy link to clipboard. 
- **upload**: Upload file to 0x0.st, and copy link to clipboard.
